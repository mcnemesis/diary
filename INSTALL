Part of the philosophy behind this project is to make it possible for anyone to host their own magical diary.

To make this simple for anyone, I've tried to keep the installation steps to bare minimum (but not the simplest for some platforms).

Prerequisites:
--------------

This project is an Django project meant to be deployed in Apache2 as a MOD WSGSI app.

It also expects to use the open-source database Postgres (but has support of any database backend supported by the Django project)

As such, the following is assumed to be (or in) one's environment:

    - Linux/Unix Platform
    - Apache2
    - mod_wsgi Apache2 module
    - Python (tested with 2.7)
    - Django Python package
    - Postgres (tested with 9.2.3)
    - A standard shell


To Customize/Personalize the Installation:
------------------------------------------

As this is a Django Project, there might be various thing one might wish to customize in order to fit the project into their custom 
environment. For this, refer to the well-documented Django project settings file (settings.py) in the project directory (diary/settings.py)

In addition to customizing the Django project, one might wish to alter the included special Apache configuration file to suit their needs,
for this, edit the file diary/diary_apache.conf.


Then finally, with the above modifications (if any), the final configuration file to change might be the included Makefile in the setup directory.


INSTALL
=========

Once the necessary prerequisites and customizations are satisfied, then installation is as simple as:

cd setup && sudo make install


UNINSTALLATION:
===============

At any time, it should be possible to entirely erase the project from one's server by running:

cd setup && sudo make uninstall


HELP:
=======

As this is a Django project, most Django-specific problems you might encounter most likely have reliable/comprehensive solutions on the internet.

Also, the Django project mantains a very holistic corpus of documentation, for those that wish to hack the internals of this project.

Should you encounter some wierd bugs or corner-cases that you think are app-specific, then please let me know (create an issue on the github project if 
possible, or contact me by mail). Alternatively, inquire from other members of the community...
