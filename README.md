MAGICAL DIARY (v.1)
=========================

This project intends to create the ultimate magician's magical diary - a very potent and useful tool to any adept or initiate of the Occult Sciences.


Background
-------------------------

I have previously kept my notes in small tidbits scattered in various directories, on various devices, etc.

It is my wish that I create 1 platform that can allow the me to record the following kinds of records:

    - Ritual Formulae
    - Performed Rituals (with reference to their formulae)
    - Lessons learnt/created
    - Reminders of things to do
    - Success obtained
    - Reflections done (e.g results of meditation)
    - Images taken/collected in relation to work
    - Arbitrary Entry

All of these having the following mandatory attributes:

    - Title
    - Summary
    - Date
    - Kind/Type (see list above)
    - Originality (original / derived / quoted)
    - Privacy (public / private)

And the optional attributes:
    
    - References
    - Tags

    - Purpose
    - Details
    
    - Partners

    - Time
    - Place (name of location)

    - Location (latitude,longitude)
    
    - Reminder-Date
    - Reminder-Time
    - Reminder-Frequency (none / once / daily / weekly / monthly / annual)

    - Primary Image
    - Secondary Image

    - Related Entries (references to other diary entries)
    

Purpose
-------------------------

I believe that this tool shall not only help the magician to keep his craft in check, but shall help one to
realize all the benefits of a methodical and systematic study and practice of the Occult Sciences.

In particular, I hope that it shall make it easy for one to:

    - Revise one's old / collected material
    - Review one's practical work
    - Re-inforce successful methods and knowledge
    - Make it easier to measure / quantify progress
    - Make it easier to record new information
    - Make it easier to share information with peers
    - Make it easier to export/ save one's notes/journals/knowledge into useful formats for long-term use
    - Allow for adaptation and integration with modern technology
    - Allow for ease of mobility (I intend to add a mobile app that connects to the server app)
    - Allow for privacy (the magician gets to host their own diary, and links their mobilility apps to the private server)

Eventually, I hope to share this innovation with other magicians or students of the Occult, and to have others contribute to this cause too.
